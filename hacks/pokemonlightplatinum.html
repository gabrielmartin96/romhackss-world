                        <!--Historia-->
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Story</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The ultimate goal in the game is to achieve the status of champion in the
                            region of Zhery, which requires obtaining all of the badges available in this region.
                            However, the journey to become a champion is not without its obstacles. Along the way,
                            players will encounter various characters from both other games and the anime, such as the
                            iconic protagonist Ash.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As if the challenge of becoming a champion wasn't enough, players must also
                            contend with the villainous Team Steam, who are causing chaos throughout the region. While
                            striving for greatness, players must also assist the other characters in the game in their
                            fight against Team Steam, all while keeping their focus on their ultimate goal of becoming a
                            champion.
